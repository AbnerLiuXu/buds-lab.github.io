Welcome to [BUDS Lab](https://github.com/buds-lab)! We are a scientific research group that leverages data sources from the built and urban environments to improve the energy efficiency and conservation, comfort, safety and satisfaction of humans.

![BUDS lab](buds-lab.github.io/nus.png)

BUDS Lab a new group in the [Dept. of Building](http://www.bdg.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} at the [School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}. [NUS is the #1 ranked university in Asia and is in the top 15 globally.](http://www.nus.edu.sg/global/rankings.html){:target="_blank"}

## Projects
* [Building Data Genome Project](https://github.com/buds-lab/the-building-data-genome){:target="_blank"} ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Building-Data-Genome-Project){:target="_blank"}) -- Collaboration with [Princeton CHAOS Lab](https://chaos.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} -- A open data set of 507 buildings from around the world with various temporal data mining techniques implemented
* [Data-Driven Buildings](http://www.datadrivenbuilding.org/){:target="_blank"} ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Data-Driven-Buildings){:target="_blank"}) -- Tutorials for building performance analysts 
* ['3for2' Buildings: Achieving Material, Energy & Space Efficiency](http://www.systems.arch.ethz.ch/research/3for2-beyond-efficiency.html){:target="_blank"} ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/3for2-Buildings-Achieving-Material-Energy-Space-Efficiency){:target="_blank"}) -- Collaboration with [ETH Z&uuml;rich Chair of Architecture and Building Systems](http://www.systems.arch.ethz.ch/){:target="_blank"} -- Through systems integration, this project builds 3 floors in the space of 2 while achieving 2 times the performance.
* [Systems THINKING](http://www.systh.ink/){:target="_blank"} -- An international research and design collective focused on enhancing buildings through better architectural and engineering solutions related to building systems.

## People

## Join BUDS Lab!
Do any (or all) of these situations describe you?
* You're an **architect, mechanical or electrical engineer, energy simulator, urban planner, or any other type of building industry professional** who has a strong curiosity in how huge amounts of temporal, spatial, and meta data about buildings and cities will change the way we design, operate, and inhabit these entities. You've gotten tired of using spreadsheets, and have started using scripting languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} or [R](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} to process larger amounts of sensor or spatial data from buildings or building information models. You want to learn more about *data science and informatics*
* You're a **data scientist, statistician, programmer, or electronics engineer** who has a strong curiosity in how IoT, web technologies, and visual analytics can be applied to buildings and cities. You've used [particle cores](https://www.particle.io/){:target="_blank"} to design your own indoor environmental sensor device and dashboard and are annoying your colleagues about how much you know about indoor air quality. *You want to learn more about buildings and cities.* 
* You've considered going back to school to get a **Masters or Ph.D. degree** while learning more about data science. Or you simply want to take a leave of absence, take a gap year, do a Fulbright grant, explore some cool stuff, etc. for 6 months or more. *You want to learn more about academia and making an impact with reproducible research.*
* You're very curious about other cultures and the concept of living and working in one of the **world's most diverse and culturally rich Asian cities**. *You want to learn more about Asia.*

If so, please contact Dr. Miller via email ([miller.clayton at gmail.com](mailto:miller.clayton@gmail.com)) and we can discuss upcoming projects and whether you'd be a good fit. Research funding, scholarships, stipends, and grant affiliation are available. Previous projects that exemplify curiosity in any of the above points is desirable.

<!-- Looking for a more standard Jekyll theme? Try out [Shiori](http://github.com/ellekasai/shiori) theme, which has Bootstrap integration.

## Solo is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).
* You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist ([example](https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504)), but would like something nicer-looking.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.

This page itself is built with Solo. It's generated from [this markdown file](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/blob/gh-pages/_includes/index.md).

## Usage

First, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then download Solo from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chibicode/solo). Start Jekyll and you should see this page up and running.

**The main file you'll be editing is `index.md`**. This becomes the content for the page.

### Other Files

* Edit `_config.yml` to change the site's title and description.
* Edit `_includes/head.html` to add custom code to `<head>`.
* Edit `_includes/scripts.html` to add custom code before `</body>`.
* Edit `CNAME` to host on a custom domain.
* Edit `README.md` before pushing your code.

### Don't use `<h1>` tags

Wthin `index.md`, do not use `<h1>` tags - `<h1>` is reserved for the site title.

### Supported Tags

Solo supports lists, `<hr>`s, `<table>`s,

> blockquotes, and...

~~~html
<pre>code blocks with syntax highlighting.</pre>
~~~

### Keep Solo up to date

Instead of downloading, you can [fork Solo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/fork) and use the "upstream" strategy described on [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to keep Solo up to date.
