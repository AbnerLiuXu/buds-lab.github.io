BUDS Lab is a scientific research group that leverages data sources from the built and urban environments to improve the energy efficiency and conservation, comfort, safety and satisfaction of humans.

Check us out on [Twitter](http://bit.ly/2nsunzs){:target="_blank"} and [GitHub](http://bit.ly/2mfifkR){:target="_blank"} and [subscribe to the email list](http://bit.ly/2mPhWAH){:target="_blank"}

![BUDS lab](buds-lab.github.io/nus.png)

BUDS Lab is in the [Dept. of Building](https://nus.edu/2mzJmtt){:target="_blank"} in the [School of Design and Environment](https://nus.edu/2myAMKc){:target="_blank"} at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu/2nsFXuj){:target="_blank"}. [NUS is the #1 ranked university in Asia and is in the top 25 globally.](https://nus.edu/2nczgAk){:target="_blank"}

## Projects
* [Building Data Genome Project](http://bit.ly/2mWsIW0){:target="_blank"} ([ResearchGate](http://bit.ly/2mWDM5r){:target="_blank"}) -- Collaboration with [Princeton CHAOS Lab](https://chaos.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} -- A open data set of hundreds of non-residential buildings from around the world with various temporal data mining techniques implemented

## People
![Clayton Miller](buds-lab.github.io/dr_clayton_miller.png)
<br>
Dr. Clayton Miller ([ResearchGate](http://bit.ly/2nirRMQ){:target="_blank"})([LinkedIn](http://bit.ly/2ncAV9h){:target="_blank"})([GitHub](http://bit.ly/2nsvUoS){:target="_blank"}) is an Asst. Professor at NUS in the BUDS Lab. He was formerly a researcher at the [Future Cities Lab](http://bit.ly/2mWFJih){:target="_blank"} and a fellow at the [Institute of Technology in Architecture](http://www.ita.arch.ethz.ch/){:target="_blank"} at the ETH Z&uuml;rich. He holds a Doctor of Sciences from the [ETH Z&uuml;rich](http://bit.ly/2nsD908){:target="_blank"}, a MSc. (Building) from the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu/2nsFXuj){:target="_blank"}, and a Masters of Architectural Engineering (MAE) and BSc. from the [University of Nebraska](http://bit.ly/2mzLhhS){:target="_blank"}.

## Join the BUDS Lab!
Do any (or all) of these situations describe you?
* You're an **architect, mechanical or electrical engineer, energy simulator, urban planner, or any other type of building industry professional** who has an intense curiosity in how huge amounts of temporal, spatial, and meta data about buildings and cities will change the way we design, operate, and inhabit these entities. 
<!-- You've gotten tired of using spreadsheets, and have started using scripting languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} or [R](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} to process larger amounts of sensor or spatial data from buildings or building information models.  -->
<!-- You want to learn more about *data science and informatics* -->
* You're a **data scientist, statistician, programmer, or electronics engineer** who has a strong curiosity in how IoT, web technologies, and visual analytics can be applied to buildings and cities. 
<!-- You've used [particle cores](https://www.particle.io/){:target="_blank"} to design your own indoor environmental sensor device and dashboard and are annoying your colleagues about how much you know about indoor air quality.  -->
<!-- *You want to learn more about buildings and cities.*  -->
* You've considered getting a **Master's or Ph.D. degree** while learning more about data science. Or you simply want to take a leave of absence, apply for a Fulbright (or other research) grant, explore some cool stuff, etc. for six months or more. 
<!-- *You want to learn more about academia and making an impact with reproducible research.* -->
<!-- * You're very curious about other cultures and the concept of living and working in one of the **world's most diverse and culturally rich Asian cities**.  -->
<!-- *You want to learn more about Asia.* -->

If so, please ([contact Dr. Clayton via email](mailto:clayton@nus.edu.sg)) to discuss upcoming projects. Research funding, scholarships, stipends, and grant affiliation are available. Previous projects that exemplify curiosity in any of the above points are desirable.

**More detailed job descriptions for Ph.D. and Post-Doctoral positions to be posted shortly!**

<!-- Looking for a more standard Jekyll theme? Try out [Shiori](http://github.com/ellekasai/shiori) theme, which has Bootstrap integration.

## Solo is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).
* You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist ([example](https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504)), but would like something nicer-looking.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.

This page itself is built with Solo. It's generated from [this markdown file](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/blob/gh-pages/_includes/index.md).

## Usage

First, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then download Solo from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chibicode/solo). Start Jekyll and you should see this page up and running.

**The main file you'll be editing is `index.md`**. This becomes the content for the page.

### Other Files

* Edit `_config.yml` to change the site's title and description.
* Edit `_includes/head.html` to add custom code to `<head>`.
* Edit `_includes/scripts.html` to add custom code before `</body>`.
* Edit `CNAME` to host on a custom domain.
* Edit `README.md` before pushing your code.

### Don't use `<h1>` tags

Wthin `index.md`, do not use `<h1>` tags - `<h1>` is reserved for the site title.

### Supported Tags

Solo supports lists, `<hr>`s, `<table>`s,

> blockquotes, and...

~~~html
<pre>code blocks with syntax highlighting.</pre>
~~~

### Keep Solo up to date

Instead of downloading, you can [fork Solo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/fork) and use the "upstream" strategy described on [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to keep Solo up to date.
