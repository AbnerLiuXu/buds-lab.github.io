BUDS Lab a new group in the [Dept. of Building](http://www.bdg.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} at the [School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}. [NUS is the #1 ranked university in Asia and is in the top 15 globally.](http://www.nus.edu.sg/global/rankings.html){:target="_blank"}

## Projects

Some initial and ongoing projects:

* [Building Data Genome Project](https://github.com/buds-lab/the-building-data-genome){:target="_blank"}([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Building-Data-Genome-Project){:target="_blank"}) -- A open data set of 507 buildings from around the world with various temporal data mining techniques implemented
* [Data-Driven Buildings](http://www.datadrivenbuilding.org/){:target="_blank"} ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Data-Driven-Buildings){:target="_blank"}) -- Tutorials for building performance analysts 
* [3for2' Buildings: Achieving Material, Energy & Space Efficiency](http://www.systems.arch.ethz.ch/research/3for2-beyond-efficiency.html){:target="_blank"} ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/3for2-Buildings-Achieving-Material-Energy-Space-Efficiency){:target="_blank"}) -- Collaboration with [ETH Zurich Chair of Architecture and Building Systems](http://www.systems.arch.ethz.ch/){:target="_blank"} -- Through systems integration this project builds 3 floors in the space of 2 while achieving 2x the performance.

<!-- Looking for a more standard Jekyll theme? Try out [Shiori](http://github.com/ellekasai/shiori) theme, which has Bootstrap integration.

## Solo is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).
* You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist ([example](https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504)), but would like something nicer-looking.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.

This page itself is built with Solo. It's generated from [this markdown file](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/blob/gh-pages/_includes/index.md).

## Usage

First, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then download Solo from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chibicode/solo). Start Jekyll and you should see this page up and running.

**The main file you'll be editing is `index.md`**. This becomes the content for the page.

### Other Files

* Edit `_config.yml` to change the site's title and description.
* Edit `_includes/head.html` to add custom code to `<head>`.
* Edit `_includes/scripts.html` to add custom code before `</body>`.
* Edit `CNAME` to host on a custom domain.
* Edit `README.md` before pushing your code.

### Don't use `<h1>` tags

Wthin `index.md`, do not use `<h1>` tags - `<h1>` is reserved for the site title.

### Supported Tags

Solo supports lists, `<hr>`s, `<table>`s,

> blockquotes, and...

~~~html
<pre>code blocks with syntax highlighting.</pre>
~~~

### Keep Solo up to date

Instead of downloading, you can [fork Solo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/fork) and use the "upstream" strategy described on [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to keep Solo up to date.
